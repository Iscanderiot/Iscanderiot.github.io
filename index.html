  <p>Hello World, my name is Evgenii "Eugene" Kolpakov. I am from Khakassian Republic, South Siberia, Russia. </p>
  <p>I like reading books, especially history and sci-fi ones, learning languages, although there's still a room to grow for me in English and just doing some phisical activity like sports or playing some games.</p>
<p></p>
  <p>And these are what we call as "Pel'meni" - basically just seasoned meat in dough. Simple but this is my favourite food</p>

  <p>I don't clearly know what I want to get exactly from THIS class, but I think it would be great to learn:
    <ul>
    <li>some soft skills</li> 
    <li>useful programming skills</li>
    <li>programming resources</li> </ul> </p>
